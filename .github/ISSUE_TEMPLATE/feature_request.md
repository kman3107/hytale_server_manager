## Problem statement

Explain why this feature matters. Describe the pain point or limitation you are facing.  
*Example:* “Switching between multiple worlds requires manually editing `config.yml`, which is error‑prone.”

## Desired solution

Describe exactly what you would like to see. Include any of the following if applicable:

- UI changes (you can attach sketches or mock‑ups)  
- New command‑line flags or API endpoints  
- Automation or integration points with existing tooling  

## Alternatives considered

List any work‑arounds you have tried or other ideas you evaluated.  
*Example:* “I could write a shell script to edit the config, but a built‑in UI would be safer.”

## Scope & impact (optional)

- **Scope:** small tweak, medium feature, or major overhaul?  
- **Impact:** who benefits (all server admins, mod developers, end‑players, etc.)  
- **Dependencies:** does the change rely on external libraries or services?

## Media (optional)

- Sketches, wireframes, or GIFs illustrating the UI flow.  
- Links to similar features in other projects for reference.

## Additional context

Any extra details that could help reviewers (performance considerations, security implications, etc.).
